# vzip - Multithreaded Compression Tool

## Overview
This project enhances the performance of a file compression tool using multithreading with the `pthread` library. The goal is to optimize the execution while ensuring correctness and compliance with project constraints.

## Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended)
- **Compiler**: `gcc` (version 11.4.0)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pthread`
  - `zlib` (install using `sudo apt install zlib1g-dev` if needed)
    
## Extra
The vzip and frame files are too large for github, so code is just here to display our work.
